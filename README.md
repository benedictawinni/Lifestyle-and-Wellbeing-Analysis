# Lifestyle-and-Wellbeing-Analysis

This analysis will discuss about how to reach work-life balance. It contains data pre-processing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and clustering analysis. In summary, gender and age are significantly affect the work-life balance score. Yet, more stress will lead to poor work-life balance. Socializing will also help us to reach a better work-life balance. I hope this analysis will be useful for the readers. Thank you!
